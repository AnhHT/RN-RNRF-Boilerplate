Create a new project with React Native
Eg. react-native init ProjectName

Then just drag all of the Contents of this git into project, override any files if needed,
Run npm i to install packages, then run project via react-native run-android (should work on iOS never tried), and the project should be up and running :)


**Dont forget to run react-native link** after install
**Also change "rnrf_boiler_latest" in the index.android.js file to what ever your project is named**
